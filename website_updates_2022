It has been a while since I maintained my website (pre-COVID times), and I have a firmer idea of who I am and what kind of work I would like to do. I've also improved quite a lot in my coding, and I would like to change themes.

So I will be using BOOKDOWN and other resources I have added to this list.  I'm going to use git with R... hopefully. Let's see! Here's hoping that I am faster at learning it this time.

I would really like to add a section with a sort of portfolio of the work I am doing now, which is less 'academic writing' and more 'data science'.
